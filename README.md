# portfolio_Grid

EDIT: Header-bg.png is throwing error - working on it. - Fixed.

The project is a result of me self-learning web development (front so far).

As such the Portfolio utilizes HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript [navbar, which I ented to replace in future]. The core purpose of this project
was to get familiar with CSS Grid and see how to utilize it and at the same time make sure old browser which don't support grid have a fallback option - flex.

The site was not created on CSS grid alone as one big grid. As the author noted, use of sections ensures nice stackings and keeps the code simple. Grid
was used only in a certain section - intro, portfolio, contact form.

Furthermore, I would like to highlight that the project 'taught' me the use of mixins / @supports / Media quaries / Gulp and clean folder system ish.

Lastly,

DISCLAIMER: This project was intended as a learning exercise and therefore fallows steps of Kevin Powell's youtube series. Unfortunatelly, I am not familiar with design side of the website.
